# Calculative-Intelligence

Developed a hybrid machine learning and deep learning pipeline to predict drugâ€“target interactions by combining graph-based embeddings (DeepWalk/Node2Vec) and chemical fingerprints (SMILES/ECFP4). Performed data cleaning, feature fusion, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and trained models such as Random Forest, SVM, MLP and GNN, achieving high predictive performance on balanced datasets.
